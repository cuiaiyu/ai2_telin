Apply the iron to the area of the cloth covering the stain for a very brief moment. Use a piece of 120-grit sandpaper to gently sand your wooden counter-tops. Remember to sand with the grain. After giving it a good once over with the 120-grit paper, switch to a piece of 180-grit sandpaper and sand the counter-tops, again keeping with the natural grain of the wood. Once you finish sanding,  apply food-safe mineral oil and rub it into the wood grain with a clean rag. Let it soak into the wood for about 30 minutes, and then wipe away any excess mineral oil residue with a paper towel."}
